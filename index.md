## Welcome to the Docs-As-Code Demo

This is a demonstration repo to show the usage of the docs-as-code methodology.
It incorporates the following tooling:

(cards-clickable)=

::::: {grid} 3
:gutter: 2

``` {grid-item-card} Sphinx

Sphinx is the documentation generator that is used to build the documentation.
```

``` {grid-item-card} Sphinx-Needs
:link: https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Sphinx-Needs adds requirements to Sphinx.
```

``` {grid-item-card} Sphinx-Book-Theme
:link: https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/

The html theme you're just looking at.
```

``` {grid-item-card} Myst-Parser
:link: https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/

A sphinx extension that allows writing docs with Markdown- in addition to restructuredText-Syntax (Sphinx default).
```

``` {grid-item-card} Doxygen
:link: https://www.doxygen.nl/

The defacto standard C++ API documentation tool
```

``` {grid-item-card} Doxysphinx

A tool we co-developed to integrate Doxygen documentations into Sphinx-Documentation.
```

``` {grid-item-card} Python
:link: https://www.python.org/

Last but not least Python, in which Sphinx was developed.
```

```{note}
:name: a note on the example data

This repo contains some example data loosely related to the "automotive domain". None, some or all parts may
have been generated by AI tools ðŸ˜ƒ. The data may not make any sense, however we still think it's better than
having "lorem ipsum" text. If you find any of the data offensive or just too stupid, please contact us and
we'll remove it.
