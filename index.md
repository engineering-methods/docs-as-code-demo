```{note}
:name: a note on the example data

This repo contains some example data loosely related to the "automotive domain". None, some or all parts may
have been generated by AI tools ðŸ˜ƒ. The data may not make any sense, however we still think it's better than
having "lorem ipsum" text. If you find any of the data offensive or just too stupid, please contact us and
we'll remove it.
